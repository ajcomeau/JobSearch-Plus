# JobSearch-Plus
A Microsoft Access application for organizing job leads and activities during a job search.

This is a split application with the data tables located in the JS2010-BE.accdb backend file and the interface
objects in JobSearchPlus.accdb.

To start the application, open the JobSearchPlus.accdb file in Access. The application will find the backend file and automatically relink the two files.

The Data subdirectory holds a backup copy of the backend file. If the copy in the main subdirectory is deleted or damaged, the program will restore the data tables from this copy.  You can clear all data from your installation simply by deleting the JS2010-BE file in the primary directory.
